# Task State

## Current Task
Story 10 implementation complete: TestFlight Polish And Privacy Review. Physical-device background/battery QA remains before external beta.

## Route Feature Story 10 - TestFlight Polish And Privacy Review
As a beta runner, I want route, GPS, Garmin, and benchmark behavior to be clear and trustworthy so I understand what RunSmart records and where limitations remain.

### Expected Files
- `RunSmartInfo.plist`
- `IOS RunSmart app/Features/Routes/SaveRouteSheet.swift`
- `IOS RunSmart app/Features/Routes/RouteDetailView.swift`
- `IOS RunSmart app/Features/Run/RunTabView.swift`
- `IOS RunSmart app/Features/Secondary/SecondaryFlowView.swift`
- `docs/qa/testflight-checklist.md`
- `docs/qa/ios-qa-checklist.md`
- `docs/qa/route-benchmark-testflight-notes.md`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `tasks/session-log.md`

### Checklist
- [x] Route/location privacy copy is clear.
- [x] Weak GPS and missing Garmin map data are handled with non-alarming copy.
- [x] Saved route deletion clarifies RunSmart-only deletion and benchmark tracking removal.
- [x] TestFlight release notes mention route/benchmark limitations.
- [x] Battery/background behavior is called out for physical-device validation.
- [ ] Physical-device battery/background run check completed before external TestFlight.

### Validation
- `plutil -lint RunSmartInfo.plist "IOS RunSmart app/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"` passed.
- Static copy check found the updated location, weak GPS, Garmin missing-map, privacy, and TestFlight notes strings.
- Simulator build passed:
  `xcodebuild -project "IOS RunSmart app.xcodeproj" -scheme "IOS RunSmart app" -destination "generic/platform=iOS Simulator" build`
- Full iPhone 17 test pass succeeded:
  `xcodebuild -project "IOS RunSmart app.xcodeproj" -scheme "IOS RunSmart app" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17" test`
- Build/test still emit pre-existing warning noise from older resume-era view models and AppIntents metadata extraction, but no Story 10 failures.

## Previous Task
Story 9 complete: Garmin Import Processing Into Route Flow.

## Route Feature Story 9 - Garmin Import Processing Into Route Flow
As a Garmin runner, I want imported activities to behave like RunSmart-recorded runs so route matching, benchmark comparisons, and reports are consistent.

### Expected Files
- `IOS RunSmart app/Services/Garmin/GarminImportProcessor.swift`
- `IOS RunSmart app/Services/Supabase/SupabaseRunSmartServices.swift`
- `IOS RunSmart app/Services/Production/RunSmartProductionServices.swift`
- `IOS RunSmart appTests/RunSmartReadinessTests.swift`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `tasks/session-log.md`

### Checklist
- [x] Garmin sync processes newest run through `processCompletedActivity`.
- [x] Garmin route points are normalized before matching when available.
- [x] Garmin run reports can show benchmark comparison through the existing matched-run report path.
- [x] Missing Garmin route points still leave a route-less import/report path.
- [x] Duplicate Garmin activities remain stable by provider activity id.
- [x] Report generation failure does not block sync status.

### Status
- [x] Added `GarminImportProcessor` to normalize Garmin activities into newest-first `RecordedRun` values.
- [x] Hydrates route points before matching when Garmin map data exists.
- [x] Keeps route-less Garmin runs processable when route points are unavailable.
- [x] Skips hidden Garmin runs before choosing the newest import.
- [x] Dedupes duplicate Garmin activity rows by provider activity id.
- [x] Supabase Garmin sync now sends the newest normalized run through `processCompletedActivity`.
- [x] Local production Garmin sync now uses the same completed-activity path for the newest gateway run.
- [x] Completed-activity persistence now saves the canonical run even when no route match is available.

### Validation
- Focused Story 9 tests passed:
  `xcodebuild -project "IOS RunSmart app.xcodeproj" -scheme "IOS RunSmart app" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17" -only-testing:"IOS RunSmart appTests/RunSmartReadinessTests/testGarminImportProcessorHydratesRoutePointsAndOrdersNewestFirst" -only-testing:"IOS RunSmart appTests/RunSmartReadinessTests/testGarminImportProcessorKeepsRouteLessRunWhenMapDataIsMissing" -only-testing:"IOS RunSmart appTests/RunSmartReadinessTests/testGarminImportProcessorSkipsHiddenRunsBeforeSelectingNewest" -only-testing:"IOS RunSmart appTests/RunSmartReadinessTests/testGarminImportProcessorDedupesDuplicateProviderActivities" test`
- Simulator build check passed:
  `xcodebuild -project "IOS RunSmart app.xcodeproj" -scheme "IOS RunSmart app" -destination "generic/platform=iOS Simulator" build`

### Checklist
- [x] Update stale test doubles to match `ResumeOptimizationServiceProtocol`.
- [x] Run the existing test target.
- [x] Keep fix scoped to tests only.

## Story 2 - Today Shell
As a runner, I want the first app tab to point me toward Today so the app starts moving toward daily runner jobs without losing current functionality.

### Expected Files
- `RunSmart/Core/DesignSystem/Components/RunSmartTabBar.swift`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `tasks/session-log.md`
- `tasks/lessons.md` if a new lesson is learned

### Checklist
- [x] Keep the existing first-tab content reachable.
- [x] Update only shell-level tab naming/iconography for the first tab.
- [x] Do not implement the full redesign.
- [x] Do not change signing, certificates, provisioning, paid services, Garmin, or HealthKit.
- [x] Run build/tests after implementation.

## Story 3 - Today Content Wrapper
As a runner, I want the Today tab to open on a lightweight daily command-center surface so the app starts to feel like RunSmart while keeping the current score/check flow available.

### Expected Files

- [x] Preserve the existing `ScoreViewModel` instance so score flow state is not reset by the wrapper.
- [x] Do not implement full Plan, Run, Coach, HealthKit, Garmin, signing, or paid-services work.
- [x] Run build/tests after implementation.

## Story 4 - Separate Plan From Report
As a runner, I want Plan and Report to be distinct top-level areas so upcoming training and past progress are not mixed together.

### Expected Files
- `RunSmart/App/MainTabViewV2.swift`
- `RunSmart/Core/DesignSystem/Components/RunSmartTabBar.swift`
- `RunSmart/Features/V2/Plan/PlanView.swift`
- `RunSmart/Features/V2/Report/ReportView.swift`
- `tasks/todo.md`

- [x] Keep the current Track/applications flow reachable from Report.
- [x] Do not implement full Run, Coach, HealthKit, Garmin, signing, or paid-services work.
- [x] Run build/tests after implementation.

## Prior Story 5 - Run Entry Point
As a runner, I want a clear Run tab so I can see where GPS tracking and manual run logging will live.

### Expected Files
- `RunSmart/App/MainTabViewV2.swift`
- `RunSmart/Core/DesignSystem/Components/RunSmartTabBar.swift`
- `RunSmart/Features/V2/Run/RunView.swift`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `tasks/session-log.md`
- `tasks/lessons.md` if a new lesson is learned

### Checklist
- [x] Add a lightweight Run surface as the middle tab content.
- [x] Show GPS start and manual log entry points as unavailable placeholders only.
- [x] Keep the current Design/redesign flow reachable from Run while product ownership is unresolved.
- [x] Do not request location permissions or change GPS/background-location behavior.
- [x] Do not implement full Coach, HealthKit, Garmin, signing, or paid-services work.
- [x] Run build/tests after implementation.

## Risks
- Existing uncommitted Swift/resource changes are present and must be preserved.
- The app still contains resume-builder product naming and flows.
- Story 2 is intentionally a shell step; it improves IA direction but does not yet create the full Today screen.
- Story 3 creates a command-center wrapper but still uses placeholder/no-plan states until approved RunSmart data models are connected.
- Story 4 separates Plan and Report with placeholder states while preserving the existing Tailor and Track flows.
- Story 5 must not touch permissions or background tracking; it is an entry-point shell story only.

## Review Notes
- Keep both changes small and reviewable.
- Existing unrelated app/resource changes remain untouched.
- Story 7 can now consume `benchmarkComparison(for:)` to render the report card without recalculating analytics in SwiftUI.
