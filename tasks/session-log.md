# Session Log

## 2026-05-12

### Task Summary
Installed a lightweight Agent OS for RunSmart iOS using router files, workflows, standards, templates, task memory, and iOS QA/TestFlight docs.

### Files Changed
- Agent routers: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`
- Task memory: `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, `tasks/session-log.md`
- Product docs: `docs/product/*`
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture/*`
- Specs/decisions/QA docs: `docs/specs/*`, `docs/decisions/*`, `docs/qa/*`
- Agent OS: `.agent-os/**/*`

### Decisions Made
- Use a thin router-based OS.
- Store detailed process in workflow files.
- Treat current RunSmart state as unclear because the tracked source still contains resume-builder naming.
- Require verification before any task is marked done.

### Next Recommended Action
Run the first planning prompt from the final report to produce an approved RunSmart iOS product brief and feature spec before changing app code.

## 2026-05-12

### Task Summary
Implemented Story 1 for RunSmart iOS improvement by creating a current-to-future information architecture mapping.

### Files Changed
- `docs/specs/runsmart-ios-ia-mapping.md`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `tasks/lessons.md`
- `tasks/session-log.md`

### Decisions Made
- Keep Story 1 documentation-only because the safe first implementation step is to map current and known app areas before editing SwiftUI navigation.
- Use five primary tabs in the recommended shell: Today, Plan, Run, Report, Profile.
- Keep Coach contextual for now instead of making it a sixth tab.
- Preserve existing features unless a later approved product decision moves, renames, or removes them.

### Next Recommended Action
Implement Story 2 only after approving the IA mapping: confirm the authoritative project/product identity, then create the smallest Today shell story.

### Validation
- IA mapping coverage check passed.
- `xcodebuild -list -project "ResumeBuilder IOS APP.xcodeproj"` succeeded.
- `xcodebuild -project "ResumeBuilder IOS APP.xcodeproj" -scheme "ResumeBuilder IOS APP" -destination "generic/platform=iOS Simulator" build` succeeded.
- `xcodebuild -project "ResumeBuilder IOS APP.xcodeproj" -scheme "ResumeBuilder IOS APP" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17" test` failed in the existing test target due to `ResumeOptimizationServiceSwiftTestingTests.swift` using outdated `optimize` argument labels.
- Simulator smoke test skipped because no runtime UI changed.
